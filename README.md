This used to be a live web app I created for a reasearch lab. No longer live but here is the source code fwiw.

It's a flask web app and was using a Postgres db in production. Has an ORM in place so it can be hooked up to anything in theory.

As this was the first real web app I made, I followed along with [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com)'s legendary [Flask Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491991739) book. The structure of the underlying application and a lot of the code organization follows his themes and topics
